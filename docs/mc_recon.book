import meBook

# "meBook" is a python class that wraps up the process of taking 
# a markdown formatted document and using pandoc to output html,ebook
# or Word doc

# originally for my (Murray) bkory writing sideline, it can be nice for 
# throwing together documentation too.
# 
# All we have to do is:
# 1) inbkantiate a Book object
# 2) fill in the basic properties of the Book
# 3) write the "chapters" which are the individual markdown text files that make the bulk
#    of the document and tell the Book about them.
# 4) execute this file like any other Python source file.
